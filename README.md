----------------------------------------------------------------
Made for people who want to keep things simple.

I originally wrote a blog system in Rust, but it was terrible, so I rewrote it in a more familiar language. 
This project should be used as a personal blog, meaning you should be the only person who uses it. But if you want
more than one to use it, go right ahead. That's fine too.

The Codebase follows the Vertical Slice Architecture, or at least it tries. Note the code does lack abstraction
and is a necessity to ensure flexibility and cleanliness, so if your contributions pertain to improving
the abstraction, thank you.

You can modify anything to your liking. 

## Contributions
I used various new tools, such as the EntityFramework & Blazor Server. I preferably want commits just from
`#first-timers-only`. But contributions from anyone is welcomed.


## Getting started
You can run SimpleBlog locally using `Docker`. Or you can build it straight from GitHub and run it using ISS Express.

## External Requirements
The only external requirement that is needed is `PostgreSQL` & `SendGrid`.
